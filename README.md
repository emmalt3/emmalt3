# About Me

I'm a developer based in North Wales, focused on systems programming, offensive security tooling, and backend infrastructure.  
I work primarily in **C, C++, and Rust**, with an emphasis on **performance, portability, and low-level development**.

Outside of tooling and exploit work, I also build and maintain the **backend infrastructure** for a large **harm reduction community**, supporting real time moderation, automation, and safety features.

## Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: C, C++, Rust  
- **Specialties**: Systems development, CLI tools, exploit frameworks, and backend automation  
- **Security Focus**: Offensive tooling, PoC development, infrastructure hardening

---

## Development Environment

- **OS**: Arch Linux (primary); Targeting Linux, Windows, as well as other UNIX systems  
- **Editor**: NeoVim  
- **Build Systems**: Cargo (Rust), CMake (C/C++)  
- **Version Control**: Git

## Cross-Platform Development

I write software that's built to run everywhere - Linux, Windows, and UNIX in general using **portable code** and **minimal dependencies**.  
This helps ensure both reliability in red team tooling and accessibility in harm reduction tech.

## Focus Areas

- **Portable, efficient CLI tools**  
- **Low-level exploit development frameworks**  
- **Backend systems for large-scale Discord communities**  
- Supporting **offensive security** work and **public interest tech**
